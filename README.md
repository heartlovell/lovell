# Offensive Security & Adversary Simulation Portfolio

> Building real-world offensive security tooling to understand how modern attacks work — and how they’re detected.

---

## 👋 Introduction

I’m an IT professional building a hands-on offensive security portfolio focused on **adversary simulation, pentesting fundamentals, and detection engineering**.

Rather than relying on certifications alone, I learn by **building**, **breaking**, and **documenting**. My work explores how attackers operate across the full lifecycle — from initial execution and command-and-control to detection and response — all within **authorized lab environments**.

This repository serves as a curated collection of projects that reflect how I think, design, and reason about security problems.

## 📂 Featured Projects

### 🔹 Adversary Simulation & Tooling
Hands-on projects focused on understanding attacker tradecraft by implementing it.

- **Lab C2 Framework (Python)**  
  Lightweight command-and-control simulation demonstrating beaconing, tasking, and response handling.  
  Includes architectural diagrams, MITRE ATT&CK mapping, and detection considerations.

- **Custom Implant Experiments (C++)**  
  Lab-only payloads exploring execution flow, process behavior, and telemetry generation for detection analysis.

---

### 🔹 Detection Engineering (Splunk)

Projects focused on identifying offensive techniques through logs and telemetry.

- **Splunk Detection Playbooks**  
  SPL queries and detection logic designed to identify simulated C2 activity and malicious behaviors.  
  Includes false-positive analysis and attacker adaptation notes.

---

### 🔹 Pentesting Labs & Write-Ups

Documented attack paths and exploitation logic from realistic lab environments.

- **Hack The Box Write-Ups**  
  End-to-end attack chains covering initial access, privilege escalation, and post-exploitation reasoning.  
  Written in a red team–style reporting format.

---

## 🧠 Methodology

For each project, I aim to answer:
- How does this attack technique actually work?
- What telemetry does it generate?
- How would a defender detect it?
- Where would detection fail?
- How would an attacker adapt?

This mindset guides every repo in this portfolio.

## ⚖️ Ethics & Disclaimer

All work documented here is conducted **solely in authorized lab environments** for educational and research purposes.  
No projects are intended for unauthorized use or real-world exploitation.

## 🚀 Career Direction

I’m actively preparing for **entry-level pentesting, purple team, or offensive security engineering roles**, where technical curiosity, ethical testing, and strong fundamentals matter more than buzzwords.

If you’re reviewing this portfolio as part of a hiring process, I’d be happy to walk through any project in detail.
