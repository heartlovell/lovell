# Offensive Security & Adversary Simulation Portfolio

> Building real-world offensive security tooling to understand how modern attacks work — and how they’re detected.

---

## 👋 Introduction

I’m an IT professional building a hands-on offensive security portfolio focused on **adversary simulation, pentesting fundamentals, and detection engineering**.

Rather than relying on certifications alone, I learn by **building**, **breaking**, and **documenting**. My work explores how attackers operate across the full lifecycle — from initial execution and command-and-control to detection and response — all within **authorized lab environments**.

This repository serves as a curated collection of projects that reflect how I think, design, and reason about security problems. Selected projects are linked below for **interactive exploration**:

- [Lab C2 Framework (Python)](./projects/lab-c2-framework/README.md)  
- [Custom Implant Experiments (C++)](./projects/custom-implant/README.md)  
- [Splunk Detection Playbooks](./projects/splunk-detections/README.md)  
- [Hack The Box Labs & Write-Ups](./projects/htb-labs/README.md)
- [Network+ Projects](./projects/network+)

## 🧠 Foundations & Self-Directed Learning

In parallel with hands-on offensive projects, I’ve built a strong foundation in **enterprise networking and Windows environments**, equivalent to **Network+–level knowledge**, and actively apply these concepts in lab-based attack and detection scenarios.

### Core Knowledge Areas

- **Networking Fundamentals**
  - TCP/IP, DNS, DHCP, ARP, routing & switching concepts
  - Common enterprise protocols and traffic patterns
  - Network segmentation, firewalls, and trust boundaries

- **Active Directory & Windows Environments**
  - Domain structure, authentication, and authorization
  - Kerberos & NTLM fundamentals
  - User, group, and privilege relationships
  - Common AD misconfigurations and attack paths

- **Network & AD Attack Techniques (Lab Environments)**
  - Credential exposure and abuse
  - Lateral movement concepts
  - Privilege escalation logic
  - Understanding how attacks propagate through real networks

- **Security Fundamentals**
  - Threat modeling and attack surfaces
  - Defense-in-depth principles
  - Logging, visibility, and detection strategy

I’m currently **working toward Security+–level coverage** to formalize these fundamentals, while continuing to focus on **practical implementation over theory alone**.

### How This Knowledge Is Applied

- Designing C2 traffic that blends into normal network behavior  
- Understanding how AD permissions and trust relationships impact attack paths  
- Writing Splunk detections reflecting real enterprise telemetry  
- Documenting attacks aligned with real-world defensive workflows

## 📂 Featured Projects

### 🔹 Adversary Simulation & Tooling
Hands-on projects focused on understanding attacker tradecraft by implementing it.

- **[Lab C2 Framework (Python)](./projects/lab-c2-framework/README.md)**  
  Lightweight command-and-control simulation demonstrating beaconing, tasking, and response handling.  
  Includes architectural diagrams, MITRE ATT&CK mapping, and detection considerations.

- **[Custom Implant Experiments (C++)](./projects/custom-implant/README.md)**  
  Lab-only payloads exploring execution flow, process behavior, and telemetry generation for detection analysis.

---

### 🔹 Detection Engineering (Splunk)

- **[Splunk Detection Playbooks](./projects/splunk-detections/README.md)**  
  SPL queries and detection logic designed to identify simulated C2 activity and malicious behaviors.  
  Includes false-positive analysis and attacker adaptation notes.

---

### 🔹 Pentesting Labs & Write-Ups

- **[Hack The Box Write-Ups](./projects/htb-labs/README.md)**  
  End-to-end attack chains covering initial access, privilege escalation, and post-exploitation reasoning.  
  Written in a red team–style reporting format.

---

## 🧠 Methodology

For each project, I aim to answer:
- How does this attack technique actually work?
- What telemetry does it generate?
- How would a defender detect it?
- Where would detection fail?
- How would an attacker adapt?

This mindset guides every repo in this portfolio.

## ⚖️ Ethics & Disclaimer

All work documented here is conducted **solely in authorized lab environments** for educational and research purposes.  
No projects are intended for unauthorized use or real-world exploitation.

## 🚀 Career Direction

I’m actively preparing for **entry-level pentesting, purple team, or offensive security engineering roles**, where technical curiosity, ethical testing, and strong fundamentals matter more than buzzwords.

If you’re reviewing this portfolio as part of a hiring process, I’d be happy to walk through any project in detail.
